# pynecone-force-graph  

I'm trying to wrap react-force-graph with pynecone. I have it working for the most simple example of rendering the graph in the browser, however I would like some more advanced features shown here:  

* [Highlight nodes/links](https://vasturiano.github.io/react-force-graph/example/highlight/) ([source](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph/blob/master/example/highlight/index.html))  


When I create a controlled trigger on_node_hover for onNodeHover everything seems to freeze, but I can print the node dict to the terminal. Any pynecone experts able to help?
